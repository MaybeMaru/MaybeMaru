# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an 18-year-old Spanish programmer and artist. I'm currently in art school and will soon start a degree in animation.  
I have a particular interest in developing software for converter programs to support programmers and artists.  
I'm especially fond of **Adobe Animate** (formerly Flash) related technologies.

Most of my work revolves around the [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) programming language ecosystem.  
I also have experience with other programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, Lua, and C#.  
I'm currently working on [Dot-Stuff](https://github.com/Dot-Stuff), creating Adobe Animate-related plugins (such as [BetterTextureAtlas](https://github.com/MaybeMaru/BetterTextureAtlas) and tools to streamline workflows for Flash animators in the [HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com/) framework.  

My ultimate dream is to establish myself in the industry and make a living through art and creating what I love.

## Commissions & Contact
My **art and programming commissions** are currently **open** for work on character design, concept art, animation, gamedev, and more.  
For more information, please contact me on **Discord** at `maybemaru`.
